# Dotfiles

> Everyone should have a dotfiles. If they don't, they just haven't realised it yet.

## Components

I drive an Arch Linux setup fueled by the tools below (with my tweaks along the way):

- [ML4W Hyprland](https://www.ml4w.com) - I liked the GUI design, colours, and developer UX
- [Astronvim](https://astronvim.com) - bootstrap my config then let me build
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev) - I really should switch to tmux
- [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) - who doesn't like cats
- [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) - feels built by someone who loves linux

> Maybe one of these days I'll actually write a guide on how to setup my setup...
